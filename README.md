# Custom Logger for Gor HTTP Request Replays
1. This repo is for the Gor Replay scripts and also provides logging of data from kibana/elasticsearch
2. After Gor Replay is done and items get logged into Elasticsearch/Kibana, by making REST API calls to ES we log custom tags/fields in the kibana index.
